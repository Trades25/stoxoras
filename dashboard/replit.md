## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework**: React with TypeScript, using Vite as the build tool and development server.

**UI Component System**: Shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives, providing a comprehensive set of accessible, customizable components. The design follows a trading platform pattern inspired by Robinhood, Coinbase, and TradingView, prioritizing information hierarchy and functional efficiency.

**Styling**: Tailwind CSS with a custom design system defined in `design_guidelines.md`. The application uses a dark-first color scheme (220 25% 8% background) optimized for financial data visualization, with HSL color variables for theming support.

**State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management and data fetching. Custom query client configured with credentials-based authentication and error handling.

**Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing, providing a lightweight alternative to React Router.

**Key Pages**:
- Market: Trading pairs display with real-time price data and buy/sell actions
- Social Trading: Master trader profiles with copy trading functionality
- Fund Account: Deposit interface for multiple wallet types
- Profile: User account management and KYC status
- Investment: Active trades and copy trading portfolio view
- Withdrawal: Withdrawal request interface

### Backend Architecture

**Server Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript, configured for ESM modules.

**Development Setup**: Custom Vite middleware integration for hot module replacement during development. The server proxies requests to Vite's dev server while handling API routes separately.

**API Structure**: RESTful API design with routes prefixed under `/api`. Currently implements placeholder routes with storage interface ready for implementation.

**Session Management**: Express session configuration prepared (connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL session storage).

**Storage Layer**: Abstracted storage interface (`IStorage`) with in-memory implementation (`MemStorage`) for development. Designed to be swapped with database-backed implementation for production.

### Database Architecture

**ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations and schema management.

**Database**: PostgreSQL (via Neon serverless driver), configured through environment variable `DATABASE_URL`.

**Schema Design**:
- `users`: Core user data with authentication, profile information, KYC status, account level, and balance
- `tradingPairs`: Market data for trading symbols across multiple asset categories
- `masterTraders`: Profiles for experienced traders available for copy trading
- `trades`: Transaction records for user trading activity

**Migration Strategy**: Drizzle Kit manages schema migrations with outputs in `./migrations` directory.

### Design System

**Typography**: Inter font family from Google Fonts with specific weight and size scales for different UI elements (display, headings, body, captions, data/prices).

**Color Palette**: 
- Dark mode primary with neutral base colors
- Accent colors for success (green), danger (red), warning (amber), and primary actions (blue)
- HSL-based color system with alpha channel support for transparency

**Layout Principles**:
- Fixed sidebar (240px, collapsible to 64px)
- Fluid main content with max-width constraint (max-w-7xl)
- Consistent spacing using Tailwind's spacing scale
- Card-based component architecture

**Component Patterns**: Trading platform-specific components including trading pair cards with mini charts (Recharts), master trader profiles, modal-based trade execution, and copy trading configuration.
